## Introduction

### Problem Statement

According to Malaysiaâ€™s National Health and Morbidity Survey, 29.2% of Malaysians aged 16 and above suffer from mental health issues. Cases have doubled over the past 10 years, with young adults (16-24 years) being the most affected group. Mental illness is projected to become the second-largest health issue in Malaysia after heart disease.

Key challenges include:

- **Lack of awareness and ignorance**: Many individuals are unaware of mental health issues or how to seek help.
- **Stigma and cultural beliefs**: Mental health is often viewed negatively, leading to social discrimination and reluctance to seek support.

### Target Users

Redawn is designed for the following groups:

- Young adults and university students (16-30 years old)
- Working adults and professionals (25-45 years old)
- Individuals experiencing financial stress
- Mental health advocates and therapists
- Employees and HR departments
- New parents and caregivers (struggling with postpartum depression, parenting stress, sleep deprivation)
- Elderly and retired individuals (50+ years old, dealing with loneliness, health anxiety, or loss of purpose)
- People recovering from mental health issues

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Redawn aligns with **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being**, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. By addressing mental health challenges, Redawn contributes to creating a healthier and more inclusive society.
